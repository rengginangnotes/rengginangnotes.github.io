Finally, sync the gradle files and rebuild the Android project. With these five simple steps, you can easily get the Android App Version Code in minutes!\n1. Gathering Required Materials To get your app version code in an Android project, you need to perform the following steps:\nOpen the ‘build.gradle’ file in your Android project. Find the version name inside the ‘defaultConfig’ section. Increment the version code with each release. Rebuild the project after changing the version code (Shift+F10). 2. Building the Android Project Building an Android project is very important for getting the app version code. To begin, open the app folder in Android Studio and locate the build.gradle file. This is the main build script where you can declare the version code for the app. The versionCode parameter is the app version number, which is used to recognize the version of the application that is currently installed on the user’s device. Once you have set the version code, save the file and click the Sync Now button at the top. Android Studio will then sync the project and generate the required resources. Finally, you can check the project’s version code in the Build field in the Project view. With these steps, you can easily get the app version code in Android.\n3.
