But for Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus users, the entire process has been made simpler and easier.

This should be at the latest level corresponding to Android 11. If the ‘Security patch level’ shows an earlier version of Android (e.g. 10), then the device has not been updated to Android 11.</p><p>In case all the above-mentioned criteria are met, you can be sure that your Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus is running on Android 11.
