Accessing Screen Recording Tool<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-accessing-screen-recording-tool>#</a></h3><p>Android has a built-in screen recorder that lets you record your screen activity and share the video. It&rsquo;s available on devices running Android 10 and above. To activate it, you need to go to your settings and look for the control called Screen Recording. When you turn it on, a floating button will appear and you can start recording the screen. To stop recording, you have to tap the marker button and then tap Stop. This will save the video to your Gallery, where you can watch, share, or edit it. You can also customize the video by changing the frame rate and resolution, and adding an audio source. With this built-in tool, it&rsquo;s easy to record the screen without needing any third-party apps.</p><h2 id=3-saving-the-video-recordings>3. Saving the Video Recordings<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-saving-the-video-recordings>#</a></h2><p>Saving the recorded video is an important part of recording your Android screen. To save the recording, simply tap the stop button located in the upper right corner of the screen. The saved recording can then be found in your device&rsquo;s gallery or in a folder you designated for it. Additionally, if you set an encoding format and resolution before starting the recording, the video will automatically have that format and resolution. This is useful for post-editing or just for future archival purposes. Moreover, it is possible to adjust the video recording quality after tapping the record button, as well as choose between a high-quality recording or a lighter recording to optimize the video size. Finally, an alternative method of sharing the saved recording is to upload them on YouTube or other video-sharing platforms.</p><h3 id=1-preparing-to-record>1.
