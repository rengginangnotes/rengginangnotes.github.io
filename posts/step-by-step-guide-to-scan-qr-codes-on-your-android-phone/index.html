You can save or take actions on the content of the QR code, like opening a link, adding contact details, or launching an app. Make sure to check the QR code’s content before you take any action. Now you can easily scan the QR code on your Android phone.</p><h3 id=2-scanning-the-qr-code-1>2. Scanning the QR Code<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-scanning-the-qr-code-1>#</a></h3><p>Scanning QR code on Android phones is incredibly simple. To begin, open the camera app and point your camera at the QR code. Make sure the QR code is in the center of the frame and the camera has focus.
