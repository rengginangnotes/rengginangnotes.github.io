Here are a few tips and tricks you need to know in order to get the best screenshotting experience. Firstly, press the Shift-Command-3 combination of keys on your laptop&rsquo;s keyboard. This will create a screenshot of the entire screen. To take a screenshot of only a certain section, press the Shift-Command-4 combination instead. Use the cursor to select the area you want to screenshot. Secondly, when pressing either of the two key combinations, the screenshot will be saved directly on your laptop&rsquo;s desktop. Alternatively, you can also choose to copy and paste the screenshot directly into an application, with the Shift-Command-Control-4 key combination. For added convenience, you can also use the Grab app to take screenshots, which can be accessed from the “Utilities” folder. Finally, use the Preview app if you want to make changes to your screenshots. The app allows you to add annotations, rotate, crop and resize your screenshots. All your screenshotting needs can now be taken care of with these easy steps.</p><h3 id=-troubleshooting-screenshotting-issues-on-mac>• Troubleshooting Screenshotting Issues on Mac<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-troubleshooting-screenshotting-issues-on-mac>#</a></h3><p>Taking a screenshot on your Apple mac laptop does not have to be a daunting task.
