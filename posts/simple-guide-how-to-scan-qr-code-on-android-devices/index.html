Google Lens is the most popular way to scan QR codes on Android devices, but there are some other alternatives that you might want to consider.

Other Alternatives for Scanning QR Codes on Android Devices<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-other-alternatives-for-scanning-qr-codes-on-android-devices-1>#</a></h3><p>Scanning a QR code on an Android device is a quick and easy process. All that is required is a QR code scanning app, such as QR Code Reader, available for free from the Google Play Store. However, there are other alternatives for scanning QR codes available, such as Google Lens or Barcode Scanner. Both of these apps are also available for free from the Google Play Store.

Barcode Scanner is designed to scan not only QR codes but also other types of barcodes. It works in the same way as Google Lens, using the Android device&rsquo;s camera to capture the appropriate code and responsible for activating the associated link.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QjHZfW5orOU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q: What is a QR code?
