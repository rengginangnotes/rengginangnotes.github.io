To do this, go to your iPhone Settings and select your Apple ID. From there, select “iCloud” and then “iCloud Backup”. Turn on iCloud Backup and press “Back Up Now” to begin the process. Once the backup is complete, you can move on to the next step.\nThe second step is to download Google Drive on your iPhone. Once it’s installed, open the app and sign in to your Google account. Once you’re logged in, press the “+” icon at the bottom right and select “Upload”. Select the files you want to transfer from your iCloud backup and press “Upload” to begin the transfer process.\nFinally, you can transfer the data from your Google Drive account to your Android device. Download the Google Drive app to your Android device, open it, and sign in with your Google account. Your uploaded files should be visible in the app. Select the files you want to transfer and press the download icon to begin the transfer. This process should move your data from your iPhone to your Android device.\n- Steps to Follow when Transferring Data Data transfer between mobile devices can be a hassle, but it doesn’t have to be. Here are some easy steps to follow when transferring data from an iPhone to an Android device. First, backup all of the data on your iPhone.

Second, install a file transfer app, such as Google Drive, and use it to transfer all of the data from your iPhone to your Android device. Third, if you have any media files, such as music or photos, you can move these manually from one device to another. Fourth, verify that all of the data has been transferred properly and delete it from the iPhone to make sure no data is stored. Following these steps will make data transfer between mobile devices a breeze.\n1. Preparing the Devices for Data Transfer Transferring data from an iPhone to an Android device is not as complicated as it may seem. When considering transferring data, there are a few important steps to follow. First, back up the data on the iPhone.
