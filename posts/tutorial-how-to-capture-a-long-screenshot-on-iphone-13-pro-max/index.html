Taking a long screenshot simply means capturing a longer image than normal by stitching together multiple screenshots. To do this on your iPhone, there are two options. The first is to use Apple&rsquo;s own built-in tools. The second is to use third-party apps that offer a longer screenshot feature.
Using Apple’s built-in tools, you can take a long screenshot by activating the “Stitch Together” feature. To do this, go to Settings > Display & Brightness and activate the toggle. With this feature enabled, you can simultaneously tap the Volume Up and Home buttons on your phone to take a longer screenshot.
For third-party apps, there are plenty of options available on the App Store. Simply search “long screenshot” to find the right app for your needs. Once you have downloaded it, you can then take a screenshot by following the app’s instructions. With the help of these tools, taking a long screenshot on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max is now a breeze.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fGhFdmsy0dk style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is a long screenshot?
